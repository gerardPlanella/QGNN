This repository contains the development and tests for a new GNN architecture optimized for quantum applications such as Quantum N-Body simulations and Mollecular synthesis. It arised from the collaboration between Gerard Planella from the University of Amsterdam and Adrian MÃ¼ller from Aalto University, supervised by Prof. Max Welling (Univesity of Amsterdam & Microsoft Research) and Prof. Vikas Garg (Aalto University).
